# Student Planner

Student Planner is a web application that helps students manage their schedules. It is inspired by the _School Planner_ Android application by Andrea Dal Cin, which can be found on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=daldev.android.gradehelper&pcampaignid=web_share).
